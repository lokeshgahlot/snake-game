```

## Build

- Dev environment

```
## Notes
- Please use latest chrome version.
- For dev environment, please use `http://localhost:8080/` url in the browser.
- Build files location `snake-game/public`
- I used composition instead of ES6 class for all components.


## Next Steps
- More walls can be added like a maze.
- More levels can be added in the game and every level would increase speed of the snake.
- For a change, More enemies can be added.
- Food (like a mouse) can be moved around the board.
